Contributing
############

After fighting with spam on MoinMoin (unsuccessfully), I decided to use
something more reliable (who needs a whole application just to publish
some pages with a few contributors, after all?).

This wiki is now written in ReStructuredText and built into HTML
by using Sphinx_.

The source code is `available as a GitHub project
<https://github.com/rshk/wiki.hackzine.org>`_.
If you want to contribute, feel free to send a pull request there.
